      <p>
        Need a <b>minimum</b> of 54 holes to start calculating your handicap
      </p>
      <!-- Below will potentially be moved to another page that explains how a handicap is calculated -->
      <!-- <p>
        That can be either 3 rounds of 18 or a combination of 9 holes (paired
        together) until 54 holes are met
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>NOTE:</b> if using 9 hole rounds those rounds will ONLY count when 2
        rounds of 9 are paired together.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Example:</b> If you have 4 rounds of 9 you will have 2 sets of '18
        hole scores' which will count as 2 rounds of golf. If you have 3 rounds
        of 9 you will have 1 set of 18 hole scores with that remaining 9 hole
        round waiting until another round of 9 is entered. Once another round of
        9 is entered it gets paired with the left over round of 9
      </p> -->

        <b>NOTE:</b> These calculations are based on the WHS (World Handicap
        System) pre 2024 change.
